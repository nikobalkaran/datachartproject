<p> 
	The 2024 Presidential Election is over, and Donald Trump has officially defeated Kamala Harris. 

</p>

<p>
	There was a noticeable red wave that swept the country even in historically blue states like New York City. 
</p>

<p>
	Kendrick Holmes, a senior lead of financial services, said he was inspired to register as a Republican because of their stance on policies.
</p>

<p>
	“At a federal level, these policies have a big impact on the people I love the most,” said Holmes, a 30-year-old Hong Kong immigrant. 
</p>

<p>
	In every election cycle since 2016, the Republican Party has gained votes in every New York City borough. The party saw the highest rise in the Bronx, with an almost 63% increase from 2016 to 2024. While Staten Island had the lowest increase of about 18%, it is the only district the Republicans won in the last three election cycles. Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens all fell in the 30% median.

<!--I was surprised to see how repsonsive the table was. I added my spreadsheet to the source link in Datawrapper and published it again, but did not copy the code. After refreshing my HTML, I saw that the table had been updated with the spreadsheet.-->
